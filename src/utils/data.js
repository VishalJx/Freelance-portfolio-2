            description: "This paper presents a novel approach for image steganography using cryptography. The proposed method uses a combination of cryptography and steganography techniques to hide the secret message within the cover image. The secret message is encrypted using a symmetric key algorithm, and the encrypted message is embedded into the cover image using the least significant bit (LSB) substitution technique. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides a high level of security and robustness against various attacks.",
